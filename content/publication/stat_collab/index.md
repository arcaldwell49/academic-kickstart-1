abstract = "Statistical errors are common in many biomedical fields. We believe the nature and impact of these errors to be great enough in sports science and medicine to warrant special attention. Poor methodological and statistical practices have led to calls for change in other fields, such as psychology. We believe that a similar call to action is needed in sports science and medicine. Specifically, we see two pressing needs:(1) to increase collaboration between researchers and statisticians, and (2) to increase statistical training within the exercise science/medicine/physiotherapy (PT) discipline. Our call to action extends the work of those who have previously called for increased statistical collaboration in sports medicine and sports injury research."
