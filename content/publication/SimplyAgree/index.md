abstract = "Accurate and reliable measurements are critical to quantitative research efforts. Based on citation counts of Bland & Altman (1986) and Weir (2005) alone, researchers appear to highly value methods to quantify the accuracy and reliability of measurement tools used for research. This article introduces the SimplyAgree R package and jamovi module as user-friendly solutions for estimating agreement and reliability (R Core Team, 2020; The jamovi project, 2021) for continuous measurements. Updates and additional details on SimplyAgree can be found on the packageâ€™s website. SimplyAgree was created for applied physiologists to use when evaluating different physiological measurements (e.g, comparing the measurement of oxygen consumption between two competing gas analyzers). However, the functions within SimplyAgree can be utilized by any researcher wanting to evaluate agreement between two continuous measurements, or for evaluating the reliability of a continuous measure."
