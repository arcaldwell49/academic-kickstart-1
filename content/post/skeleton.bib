@misc{Lohse2020, title={Systematic Review of the use of “Magnitude-Based Inference” in Sports Science and Medicine}, url={http://dx.doi.org/10.31236/osf.io/wugcr}, DOI={10.31236/osf.io/wugcr}, abstractNote={<p>Magnitude-based inference (MBI) is a controversial statistical method that has been used in hundreds of papers in sports science despite criticism from statisticians. To better understand how this method has been applied in practice, we systematically reviewed 232 papers that used MBI. We extracted data on study design, sample size, and choice of MBI settings and parameters. Median sample size was 10 per group (interquartile range, IQR: 8 – 15) for multi-group studies and 14 (IQR: 10 – 24) for single-group studies; few studies reported a priori sample size calculations (15%). Authors predominantly applied MBI’s default settings and chose “mechanistic/non-clinical” rather than “clinical” MBI even when testing clinical interventions (only 14 studies out of 232 used clinical MBI). Using these data, we can estimate the Type I error rates for the typical MBI study. Authors frequently made dichotomous claims about effects based on the MBI criterion of a “likely” effect and sometimes based on the MBI criterion of a “possible” effect. When the sample size is n=8 to 15 per group, these inferences have Type I error rates of 12%-22% and 22%-45%, respectively. High Type I error rates were compounded by multiple testing: Authors reported results from a median of 30 tests related to outcomes; and few studies specified a primary outcome (14%). We conclude that MBI has promoted small studies, promulgated a “black box” approach to statistics, and led to numerous papers where the conclusions are not supported by the data. Amidst debates over the role of p-values and significance testing in science, MBI also provides an important natural experiment: we find no evidence that moving researchers away from p-values or null hypothesis significance testing makes them less prone to dichotomization or over-interpretation of findings.</p>}, publisher={Center for Open Science}, author={Lohse, Keith and Sainani, Kristin and Taylor, J.

A report of the study therefore usually includes an inference about the true value. Traditionally, a researcher makes an inference by declaring the value of the statistic statistically significant or non significant on the basis of a <jats:italic>P</jats:italic> value derived from a null-hypothesis test. This approach is confusing and can be misleading, depending on the magnitude of the statistic, error of measurement, and sample size. The authors use a more intuitive and practical approach based directly on uncertainty in the true value of the statistic. First they express the uncertainty as confidence limits, which define the likely range of the true value. They then deal with the real-world relevance of this uncertainty by taking into account values of the statistic that are substantial in some positive and negative sense, such as beneficial or harmful. If the likely range overlaps substantially positive and negative values, they infer that the outcome is unclear; otherwise, they infer that the true value has the magnitude of the observed value: substantially positive, trivial, or substantially negative. They refine this crude inference by stating qualitatively the likelihood that the true value will have the observed magnitude (eg, very likely beneficial). Quantitative or qualitative probabilities that the true value has the other 2 magnitudes or more finely graded magnitudes (such as trivial, small, moderate, and large) can also be estimated to guide a decision about the utility of the outcome.</jats:p>}, number={1}, journal={International Journal of Sports Physiology and Performance}, publisher={Human Kinetics}, author={Batterham, Alan M. and Hopkins, William G.}, year={2006}, month={Mar}, pages={50–57} }
